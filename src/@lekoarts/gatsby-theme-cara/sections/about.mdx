## About

> As a former rooftop farmer, I find it a tad bit ironic that I still spend most my days in the cloud!

Agriculture and environmental design, policy, and planning were my passion for a long time. Creating community around food, and land use and ethic was a daily struggle, but tech was the hobby I used to leverage those efforts. My hope with transitioning careers, is to develop the proficiency to deploy my creative ideas in an instant, and to leverage the tech community to help provision resources for environmental sustainability!
